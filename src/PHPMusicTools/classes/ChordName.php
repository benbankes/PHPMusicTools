/**
 * This class is fascinating because it extends the idea of representing scales as a binary number into 
 * tertiary chords! 
 * for example, a root tone is 1,
 * a root plus a minor third is 1001,
 * a root plus a major third is 10001,
 * a major triad is 10010001
 * 
 * In this way, we can name all kinds of named chords in the same way we name our scales, right up to
 * giant numbers for interesting colourized thirteenths
 *
 * We will also make this class capable of figuring out what chords are compatible
 * with scales
 *
 * There are some interesting possibilities here with chords that don't contain a root tone.
 * For instance, we could define elements of harmonic analysis by identifying the tones of a chord
 * that aren't the "I" - e.g. 100010010 is the "bii" and 100100010000 is a "III", and we could
 * also identify French Neopolitan sixths and stuff like that

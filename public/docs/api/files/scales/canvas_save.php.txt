 Be aware that this script is really, really insecure. Having it available
 on your web server is a giant security vulnerability that could cause
 untold damage if used maliciously.

 For the purposes of a public repo, I'm going to put a die() in here, so
 it won't end up on someone's server accidentally as a giant
 security vulnerability. If you want to use the image generator, remove the
 die(), then run the script, then put the die() back again.
